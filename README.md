# EV Bet Calculator

Python desktop application project i created for myself to analyze my sports and esports bets and that would calculate "real EV" and compare the 2 odds and tell which one is more worth to bet and show how many won bets i had with the odds im comparing. Fetches real-time data from Google sheet that i have created. Also shows the statistics of the bets you have done (WIP).
